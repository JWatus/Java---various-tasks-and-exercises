/*
Java 8 has introduced a sexy new Stream API which makes it possible to solve some data related problems in just a
few lines of code. Let's try it out!

        You have a Student class (see the class declaration below).

        You have an array of students and you want to get some aggregate data.

        THE TASK: get the names of the students by department.

        Implement the method using Java 8 Stream API.

        Have Fun!

        Student class declaration:
